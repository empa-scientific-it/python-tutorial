    "## Introduction\n",
    "An important aspect to learn in a new programming language is input/output (or I/O). For our program to be useful, we need to be able to interact with the outside world. This means performing operartions like:\n",
    "- reading and writing data to a file\n",
    "- printing text output\n",
    "- asking for user input\n",
    "- connecting to databases or other network services\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of these operations are covered by the python standard library. We are going to see how to use them in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ In reference to the chapter on functional programming, it is interesting to note that these functions perform so-called *side-effects*; therefore any code containing these operations is no longer *pure* and is not referentially transparent. The same function can return different values for the same argument if called multiple time and the function can have *long-distance* effects, that is it can modify the state of the program somewhere else leading to unexpected results. Therefore, I always suggest trying to separate input and output from the other computations in your program. For example, if you have a complex calculation requring several user inputs at several stages of the process, consider writing a function that only performs the calculation given all inputs and then require all inputs separately, for example through a single file. This makes your code easier to debug, test and understand.\n",

    "## File I/O\n",
    "A second very common I/O operation in most programming languages is reading and writing from files. This is actually more complex than just writing on the console and consists of several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to find *where* in the operating system the file is located. This gives you the so-called *path* to the file\n",
    "2. You need to *open* the file for reading or writing. In some operationg systems, this *locks* the file, so that other users or processes cannot write simultaneously with you.\n",
    "3. Now , you can write (or read) the contents of the file \n",
    "4. Finally, you need to *close* the file to make it accessible to other processes again and to finalise the writing: in some implementations, `write` only writes the text to a temporary location in memory (a so-called *buffer*) and only writes the content to the file when you close it. This is done to increase response times, as writing to memory is faster than writing to a file on the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading from a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to do this with an example: we want to open the file [hello.txt](./data/hello.txt) and read its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The path is already identified, we know the file is in `./data/hello.txt`. We save this in a variable `path`\n",
    "2. We now can use the built-in function [`open`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) to open the file. This function returns a [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object) that we can use to further manipulate the file. To ensure we only open the file for reading, we pass the string \"r\" to the second argument of `open`.\n",
    "3. Now we can read the contents using `read`, `readline` or `readlines`. `read` only reads `n` characters from the file, `readline` reads a whole line, while `readlines` reads the whole file content as a list of strings, one item per line in the file. This knowledge is useful when we only want to read part of a file or when the file is too big to fit in memory and we can only read parts.\n",
    "4. Finally, we close the file using the `close` method on the file object.\n",
