    "## Introduction\n",
    "An important aspect to learn in a new programming language is input/output (or I/O). For our program to be useful, we need to be able to interact with the outside world. This means performing operations like:\n",
    "- reading and writing data to a file\n",
    "- printing text output\n",
    "- asking for user input\n",
    "- connecting to databases or other network services\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of these operations are covered by the python standard library. We are going to see how to use them in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "⚠️ In reference to the chapter on functional programming, it is interesting to note that these functions perform <b>side-effects</b>. Therefore, any code containing these operations is no longer <b>pure</b> and is not referentially transparent. The same function can return different values for the same argument if called multiple times, and the function can have <b>long-distance</b> effects. That means they can modify the program state elsewhere leading to unexpected results. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Therefore, we suggest separating input and output from the other computations in your program. For example, if you have a complex calculation requiring several user inputs at several stages of the process, consider writing a function that only performs the calculation given all inputs and then requires all inputs separately, for example, through a single file. This makes your code easier to debug, test and understand.\n",

    "## File I/O\n",
    "A second common I/O operation in most programming languages is reading from and writing to files. This is more complex than just writing on the console and consists of several steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to find *where* in the operating system the file is located. This gives you the so-called *path* to the file.\n",
    "2. You need to *open* the file for reading or writing. In some operating systems, this *locks* the file, so that other users or processes cannot write simultaneously with you. This operation gives you a *file handle* that you can use to read or write.\n",
    "3. Now, you can read (or write) the contents of the file. \n",
    "4. Finally, you need to *close* the file to make it accessible to other processes again and to finalize the writing. In some implementations, `write` only writes the text to a temporary location in memory (a so-called *buffer*) and only writes the content to the file when you close it. This is done to increase response times, as writing to memory is faster than writing to a file on the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a trick to remember closing files: *a file handle is like a door handle*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Paths\n",
    "To handle the *where* a file is located, python offers the `pathlib` module, which is used to represent *paths* to files in a portable manner. This means that you can use one Python object to represent the location of a file regardless of the operating system, and Python will convert it into a representation specific to the operating system where you are executing the program. For example, Windows uses `\\\\` as a separator for path elements, while Unix/Linux use `/`. If you use pathlib, you can write code using only `/` and `pathlib`  will automatically select the correct path separator where the program runs\n",
