    "## 2. Use case: spatial data\n",
    "Another place where scipy shines is the processing of **spatial data**. \n",
    "This rather generic terms is used to describe data on a plane that represent the locations and shapes of objects, for example maps.\n",
    "Scipy offers some useful functions to perform basic processing on this data, although for more complex cases there are specific libraries to manipulate and process geospatial data such as [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) that support advanced features like conversion between different geographical coordinate systems, conversion of file format and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Example: nearest neighbor search\n",
    "This use case is inspired by a real question a researcher at Empa asked us. \n",
    "They approached us for help in analyzing microscopy imaging: they wanted to determine the distribution of the relative orientation angle of bacteria as a function of their distance. This means performing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Segment an image and extract the outline of each bacteria. \n",
    "2. From the outline, we can estimate the direction of the bacteria with respect to the image axis as well as the center point of the bacteria\n",
    "3. For each bacteria, iterate over all other bacteria forming pairs (bacteria1, bacteria2)\n",
    "4. For each pair (bacteria1, bacteria2) compute the relative orientation and the distance and store it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The user quickly realized that for a large number of cells in an image this algorithm becomes prohibitively slow to compute. \n",
    "Because we perform a pairwise comparison of points, the time (the number of steps) needed to compute the the relative distances and orientations grows with the square of the number of cells. \n",
    "However, the user knew that they didn't want to compute **all** distances and orientations but just those **smaller than a certain threshold**.\n",
    "Thanks to this knowledge and the use of scipy, we could find a method to make their computation much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we used a special data structure called a [**k-d Tree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree); this data structure represents a set of k-dimensional points as a tree where each node of the tree splits the space in exactly two halves along one of the coordinates. Thanks to this property, we can very quickly find the nearest points to a given point because at every step in the tree we directly eliminate half of the space to search in. For a better visualization of this idea, please check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp7THUpGow).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to use this structure with a simplified example. \n",
    "To begin with, we create a set of points in the plane, to each of the point we attach a number between 0 and $2\\pi$ that represent the orientation of the bacteria with respect to the coordinate system.\n",

    "Another example of the use of scipy for spatial data comes from the experience of one of us (S. Baffelli). In my past experience as a postdoctoral researcher, I was trying to design an atmospheric sensor network for $CO_2$ observation. The sensors were supposed to be installed at cell sites provided by Swisscom, one of the major Swiss telecom providers. While Swisscom had more than 60 sites in Z√ºrich, only around 20 sensors were available. The goal was then to select cell sites in order to obtain a spatially uniform coverage of the city with sensors.\n",
    "In other words, the task was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a list of $n$ coordinates $(x, y)$, select $k$ points out of $n$ so that the area covered by each sensor is balanced: we don't want large gaps in coverage and we don't want some sensors to cover too big of an area.\n",
