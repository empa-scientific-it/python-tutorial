    "\n",
    "1. **Triggering a custom behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Division by zero is not allowed\")\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, we explicitly raise a `ValueError` when we detect an invalid operation, instead of relying on Python's default behavior, which would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "The main reason to do this is to provide a more meaningful error message, or perform some other actions if a particular exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Raising custom exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create custom exceptions by defining a class.\n",
    "We'll see how to work with classes and objects on the last day of the tutorial, but now just remember that's another\n",
    "Here's an example of how to define a custom exception:\n",

    "    try:\n",
    "        # do something like trying to access the file\n",

    "- It creates a clear chain of exceptions, showing how one error led to another\n",
    "- It helps in debugging by maintaining the full error context\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Re-raising exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we do not need custom exceptions, but it might be useful to perform some actions *before* Python raises an uncaught exception.\n",
    "For example, logging the error somewhere if our program is not running interactively (because maybe it's processing our data overnight).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def process_data(data):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Some processing ...\n",
    "        result = data['key'] / 0\n",

    "        print(\"Logging error...\")\n",
    "        raise  # Re-raises the same exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply using `raise` without arguments is useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to preserve the original traceback (i.e., the full *error context*)\n",
