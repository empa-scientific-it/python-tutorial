    "**Code** is simply a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.\n",
    "When you write Python code, you are writing instructions in a language that humans can read and computers can execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a recipe:\n",
    "- A recipe has steps written in a human language\n",
    "- Code has steps written in a programming language (Python, in our case)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Statements and lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python code is written as **statements**, meaning individual instructions that do something.\n",
    "Each statement is typically written in a new line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 10\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello!\")\n",

    "name = \"Alice\"   # This is different from...\n",
