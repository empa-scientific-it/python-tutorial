    "### What is code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code** is simply a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.\n",
    "When you write Python code, you are writing instructions in a language that humans can read and computers can execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a recipe:\n",
    "- A recipe has steps written in a human language\n",
    "- Code has steps written in a programming language (Python, in our case)\n",
    "- Just as a chef follows a recipe, the computer follows your code\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Syntax** refers to the rules for how code must be written.\n",
    "Just like any natural language, programming languages have syntax rules too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basic Python syntax rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Statements and lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python code is written as **statements**, meaning individual instructions that do something.\n",
    "Each statement is typically written on a new line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "z = x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 2. Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that in the example above we used `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n",
    "These are **variables**.\n",
    "Variable names can use any alphanumeric character (letters and numbers) and underscore, but they **cannot** start with numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good practice to choose variable names that describe what they are used for.\n",
    "Try to avoid placeholders, or generic names such as `x`, `y`, `my_variable`, or `func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gamma_factor` is **valid**\n",
    "- `_planck_constant` is **valid**\n",
    "- `epsilon_0` is **valid**\n",
    "- `1_item` is **not** valid (because it starts with a number)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **variable** is like a label you can assign to an object.\n",
    "Think of it as giving a name to a value so you can refer to it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5           # Create a variable named 'x' and assign the number 5 to it\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"  # Create a variable named 'name' and assign the text \"Alice\" to it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `=` symbol is called the **assignment operator**.\n",
    "Note that it does not mean \"equals\" like in math. \n",
    "It means \"store the value on the right into the variable on the left.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are useful because they allow you to:\n",
    "- **Reuse** the same value multiple times\n",
    "- **Change** the value later if needed\n",
    "- Make your code more **readable** (using `name` instead of just `Alice`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"assignment\" (binding names to objects) also happens with:\n",
    "- Function definitions\n",
    "- `import` statements\n",
    "- Some language constructs (such as `for`, `while`, `with` , which all imply assignments)\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have to go into detail here, but these are worth mentioning."

    "name = \"Alice\"   # This is different from...\n",
