    "# Parallelism and concurrency in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "There are many cases where we could execute multiple tasks in parallel or switch between tasks while we wait for some time consuming task to be completed.\n",
    "You can just think of examples from daily life to see why: \n",
    "\n",
    "- While your soup cooks on the stove, you start washing your dishes\n",
    "- You check the news while drinking your morning coffee\n",
    "- You work on your python course exercises while attending a video call\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the language of computing is so engrained in many of us that today we refer to these sort of behaviors as *multitasking*, an expression borrowed from computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because in computer science we like to be precise, let us define these terms better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parallelism Vs. concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallelism\n",
    "When we have two or more tasks *running and progressing simultaneously*, we can talk about **parallelism**. Think for example of the situation of paying at the supermarket where there are multiple lines: more than one customer can pay their purchases at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concurrency\n",
    "When two or more tasks run in overlapping time periods (but **not necessarily simultaneously**) instead of sequentially, we say that their execution is **concurrent**.\n",
    "This is the typical human multitasking, where we work on multiple tasks in a time period, but we must switch between them to be able to perform them correctly.\n",
    "For example, we sit in a meeting, listen passively while working on our python program and stop working on our code to answer a question directed to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below can help you understanding the difference between concurrent and parallel work.\n",

A first good starting point is the [`concurrent.futures`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) module of the python standard library. This module wraps the methods of `multiprocessing` (and `multithreading`) modules and offers more convenient ways to launch parallel computations.\n",

    "- It repeats the steps above until it exhausts the data to process\n",

    "As you can see from the graph, there is a clear difference in execution time between `sequential_work` and `parallel_work` as the number `n` increases. This is due to the fact that if we execute the function `work` sequentially for `n` inputs, we need to wait **at least** `n` times the duration of execution of `work`. On the other hand, if we process in parallel, we can cut down the time by maximally `n_proc` where `n_proc` is the number of CPUs our system offers. In reality, the speed up will be a bit smaller because of the overhead of starting different processes and the synchronisation effort.\n",
