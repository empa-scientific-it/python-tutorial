    "It offers a wide range of functionalities for plotting graphs, histograms, bar charts, and more.\n",

    "It is widely used in various domains such as data analysis or machine learning, for visualizing data and results in a more understandable manner."

    "\n",
    "Matplotlib provides high-quality and publication-ready plots with customization options for colors, labels, annotations, and more. It is highly extensible and allows users to create custom plots or modify existing ones.\n",

    "### Integration with other libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib integrates seamlessly with NumPy or Pandas, making it easy to plot data directly from NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames.\n",

    "## Display Basics: Figures and axes\n",
    "\n",
    "On Matplotlib, the basic unit of a graphic is called a [`Figure`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure).\n",
    "Each `Figure` can contain one or more [`Axes`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html#the-axes-class).\n",
    "An `Axes` is an area where points can be specified in terms of coordinates (x-y in a 2D plot, x-y-z in a 3D plot, etc.).\n",
    "The simplest way of creating a `Figure` with an `Axes` is using `pyplot.subplots`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Figure` keeps track of all the child `Axes`, a group of 'special' `Artists`, or even nested subfigures.\n",
    "It is often convenient to create the `Axes` together with the `Figure`, but you can also manually add `Axes` later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Artist\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, everything visible in the `Figure` is an `Artist`, i.e. titles, figure legends, collections objects, and even `Figure` and `Axis` objects.\n",
    "When the `Figure` is rendered, all of the `Artists` are drawn to the canvas.\n",
    "Most `Artists` are tied to an `Axes`; such an `Artist` cannot be shared by multiple `Axes`, or moved from one to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axes\n",
    "\n",
    "An `Axes` is an `Artist` attached to a `Figure` that contains a region for plotting data, and usually includes `Axis` objects \n",
    "Each `Axes` also has a title (set via `set_title()`), an x-label (set via `set_xlabel()`), and a y-label set via `set_ylabel()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axis\n",
    "\n",
    "These objects set the scale and limits and generate ticks (the marks on the Axis) and ticklabels (strings labeling the ticks)."
