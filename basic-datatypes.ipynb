    "## (basic) Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several build in data types.\n",
    "We distinguish basic types and data structures.\n",
    "These are the most commonly used basic types:\n",
    "  1. Integers (`int`), e.g. `1`, `-2`, `0`, `100`\n",
    "  2. Floats (`float`), e.g. `1.0`, `-2.5`, `0.0`, `100.0`\n",
    "  3. Strings (`str`), e.g. `\"Hello\"`, `\"World\"`, `\"1\"`, `\"2.5\"`\n",
    "  4. Booleans (`bool`), e.g. `True`, `False`\n",
    "  5. NoneType (`NoneType`), e.g. `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used data structures are:\n",
    "  1. Lists (`list`), e.g. `[1, 2, 3]`, `[\"Hello\", \"World\"]`, `[1, 2.5, \"Hello\"]`\n",
    "  2. Tuples (`tuple`), e.g. `(1, 2, 3)`, `(\"Hello\", \"World\")`, `(1, 2.5, \"Hello\")`\n",
    "  3. Dictionaries (`dict`), e.g. `{\"key1\": 1, \"key2\": 2}`, `{\"key1\": \"Hello\", \"key2\": \"World\"}`, `{\"key1\": 1, \"key2\": 2.5, \"key3\": \"Hello\"}`\n",
    "  4. Sets (`set`), e.g. `{1, 2, 3}`, `{\"Hello\", \"World\"}`, `{1, 2.5, \"Hello\"}`\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between built-in data types and data structures is that the built-in data types are the basic building blocks for representing and manipulating data.\n",
    "Whereas data structures are more complex ways of organizing and storing collections of data."
