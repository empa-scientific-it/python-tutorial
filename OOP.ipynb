    "An **Intcode program** is a list of integers separated by commas (e.g. `1, 0, 0, 3, 99`). The first number is called \"position `0`\". Each number represents either an **opcode** or a **position**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An opcode indicates what to do and it's either `1`, `2`, or `99`. The meaning of each opcode is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `99` means that the program should immediately terminate. No instruction will be executed after encountering this opcode;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `1` **adds** together numbers read from **two positions** and stores the result in a **third position**. The three integers **immediately after** the opcode indicates these three positions. For example, the Intcode program `1,10,20,30` should be executed as: read the values at positions `10` and `20`, add those values, and the overwrite the value at position `30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `2` works exactly like opcode `1`, but it **multiplies** the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers following the opcode indicates **where** the inputs and outputs are, not their **values**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when the program is done with an opcode, it moves to the next one by stepping **forward 4 positions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following program\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "1,9,10,3,\n",
    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line represents the **sum** (opcode `1`) of the values stored at positions `9` (that is `30`) and `10` (that is `40`). The result (`70`) is then stored at position `3`. Afterward, the program becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1,9,10,70,\n",
    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepping forward by 4 positions, we end up on the second line, which represents a **multiplication** operation (opcode `2`). Take the values at positions `3` and `11`, multiply them, and save the result at position `0`. You obtain:\n",
    "\n",
