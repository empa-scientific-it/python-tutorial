    "# Introduction\n",
    "In Python, we distinguish built-in data types and structures, which are more complex ways to organise and store data collections.\n",
    "In this tutorial we will cover the most commonly used ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in data types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several built-in data types in Python.\n",
    "The most commonly used ones are the following:\n",
    "  1. Integers (`int`), e.g.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  1, -2, 0, 100\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  2. Floats (`float`), e.g.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  1.0, -2.5, 0.0, 100.0\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  3. Strings (`str`), e.g. \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  \"Hello, World\", \"1\", \"2.5\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  4. Booleans (`bool`), e.g. \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  True, False\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  5. NoneType (`NoneType`), e.g. \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  None\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "The built-in data types are the basic building blocks for representing and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data structures\n",
    "Data structures are more complex ways of organizing and storing data collections.\n",
    "Data structures may contain built-in data types as well as other data structures.\n",
    "The most commonly used data structures are:\n",
    "  1. Lists (`list`), e.g.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  [1, 2, 3], [\"Hello\", \"World\"], [1, 2.5, \"Hello\"]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  2. Tuples (`tuple`), e.g.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  (1, 2, 3), (\"Hello\", \"World\"), (1, 2.5, \"Hello\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  3. Dictionaries (`dict`), e.g.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  {\"key1\": 1, \"key2\": 2}, {\"key1\": \"Hello\", \"key2\": \"World\"}, {\"key1\": 1, \"key2\": 2.5, \"key3\": \"Hello\"}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  4. Sets (`set`), e.g.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  {1, 2, 3}, {\"Hello\", \"World\"}, {1, 2.5, \"Hello\"}\n",
    "  ```\n",
