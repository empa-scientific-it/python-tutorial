    "An **Intcode program** is a list of integers separated by commas (e.g. `1, 0, 0, 3, 99`). The first number is called \"position `0`\". Each number represents either an **opcode** or a **position**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An opcode indicates what to do and it's either `1`, `2`, or `99`. The meaning of each opcode is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `99` means that the program should immediately terminate. No instruction will be executed after encountering this opcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `1` **adds** together numbers read from **two positions** and stores the result in a **third position**. The three integers **immediately after** the opcode indicates these three positions. For example, the Intcode program `1,10,20,30` should be executed as: read the values at positions `10` and `20`, add those values, and the overwrite the value at position `30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `2` works exactly like opcode `1`, but it **multiplies** the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers following the opcode indicates **where** the inputs and outputs are, not their **values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when the computer is done with an opcode, it moves to the next one by stepping **forward 4 positions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following program\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\n",

    "1,9,10,3,\n",
    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line represents the **sum** (opcode `1`) of the values stored at positions `9` (that is `30`) and `10` (that is `40`). The result (`70`) is then stored at position `3`. Afterward, the program becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1,9,10,70,\n",
    "2,3,11,0,\n",
    "99,\n",
    "30,40,50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepping forward by 4 positions, we end up on the second line, which represents a **multiplication** operation (opcode `2`). Take the values at positions `3` and `11`, multiply them, and save the result at position `0`. You obtain:\n",

    "On a boring and rainy Sunday afternoon, you decide that you want to attempt writing a Python program that simulates the orbits of Jupiter's moons. To start with, you decide to focus your efforts on tracking just **four** of the largest moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a brief scan and some careful calculations, you successfully record the **position of each moon in a 3-dimensional space**. You set each moon's velocity to `0` in each direction, and the starting point for their orbits. Your next task is to simulate their motion over time, so you can avoid any potential collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can simulate the motion of the moons in **time steps**. At each time step, first update the **velocity** of evey moon by computing the **gravity interaction** with the other moons. Then, once all the velocities are up to date, you can update the **position** of every moon by applying their velocities. Afterwards, your simulation can advance by one time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a simulation, proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider every **pair** of moons. On each axis, the velocity changes by **exactly `+1` or `-1`**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To determine the sign of the velocity change, consider the moons' positions. For example, if $G$ stands for Ganymede and $C$ for Callisto:\n",
    "    * If $G_x = 3$ ‚Äì that is, the `x` position of Ganymede ‚Äì and $C_x = 5$, then Ganymede's `x` velocity changes by `+1` (because `5 > 3`), and Callisto's `x` velocity must change by `-1` (because `3 < 5`).\n",
    "    * If the positions on a given axis **are the same**, then the velocity on that axis doesn't change at all.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Once the gravity has been calculated, update the velocity: simply **add the velocity** of each moon to its current position. For example, if Europa's position is `x=1, y=2, z=3` and its velocity `x=-2, y=0, z=3`, then the new position would be `x=-1, y=2, z=6`.\n",
