    "## File I/O\n",
    "A second common I/O operation in most programming languages is reading from and writing to files. This is more complex than just writing on the console and consists of several steps\n",

    "1. You need to find *where* in the operating system the file is located. This gives you the so-called *path* to the file.\n",
    "2. You need to *open* the file for reading or writing. In some operating systems, this *locks* the file, so that other users or processes cannot write simultaneously with you. This operation gives you a *file handle* that you can use to read or write.\n",
    "3. Now, you can read (or write) the contents of the file. \n",
    "4. Finally, you need to *close* the file to make it accessible to other processes again and to finalize the writing. In some implementations, `write` only writes the text to a temporary location in memory (a so-called *buffer*) and only writes the content to the file when you close it. This is done to increase response times, as writing to memory is faster than writing to a file on the disk.\n",

    "As a trick to remember closing files: *a file handle is like a door handle*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Paths\n",
    "To handle the *where* a file is located, Python offers the `pathlib` module, which is used to represent *paths* to files in a portable manner.\n",
    "This means that you can use one Python object to represent the location of a file regardless of the operating system, and Python will convert it into a representation specific to the operating system where you are executing the program.\n",
    "For example, Windows uses `\\` as a separator for path elements, while Unix/Linux use `/`.\n",
    "If you use pathlib, you can write code using only `/` and `pathlib`  will automatically select the correct path separator where the program runs.\n",

    "Let's see how to generate a `path` object pointing to the text file [`hello.txt`](./tutorial/tests/data/hello.txt) in the main directory of this repository.\n",
    "To do so, we use the [`Path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#basic-use) class of `pathlib` module, whose constructor takes the location of the file as a string:\n",

    "1. The path is already identified, we know the file is in `./data/hello.txt`. We save this in a variable `path`.\n",
    "2. We now can use the built-in function [`open`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) to open the file. This function returns a [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object) that we can use to further manipulate the file. To ensure we only open the file for reading, we pass the string \"r\" to the second argument of `open`.\n",
    "3. Now we can read the contents using `read`, `readline` or `readlines`. `read` reads the whole file content into a single string, `readline` reads one line, while `readlines` reads the whole file content as a list of strings, one item per line in the file. This knowledge is useful when we only want to read part of a file or when the file is too big to fit in memory and we can only read parts.\n",

This is useful for interacting with measurement data and other non-textual information like images, machine learning model parameters and other complex strcuture, although in most cases you won't need the low-level control of binary I/O and will use libraries instead. \n",
