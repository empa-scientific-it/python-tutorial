    "A second common I/O operation in most programming languages is reading from and writing to files. This is more complex than just writing on the console and consists of several steps\n",

    "1. You need to find *where* in the operating system the file is located. This gives you the so-called *path* to the file.\n",
    "2. You need to *open* the file for reading or writing. In some operating systems, this *locks* the file, so that other users or processes cannot write simultaneously with you. This operation gives you a *file handle* that you can use to read or write.\n",
    "3. Now, you can read (or write) the contents of the file. \n",
    "4. Finally, you need to *close* the file to make it accessible to other processes again and to finalize the writing. In some implementations, `write` only writes the text to a temporary location in memory (a so-called *buffer*) and only writes the content to the file when you close it. This is done to increase response times, as writing to memory is faster than writing to a file on the disk.\n",

    "As a trick to remember closing files: *a file handle is like a door handle*. \n",

    "### Paths\n",
    "To handle the *where* a file is located, Python offers the `pathlib` module, which is used to represent *paths* to files in a portable manner.\n",
    "This means that you can use one Python object to represent the location of a file regardless of the operating system, and Python will convert it into a representation specific to the operating system where you are executing the program.\n",
    "For example, Windows uses `\\` as a separator for path elements, while Unix/Linux use `/`.\n",
