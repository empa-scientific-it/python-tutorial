    "## Introduction\n",
    "Functional programming is an approach to programming where programs are built by composing and running functions that perform a series of transformations on data.\n",
    "This contrasts with the approach of *imperative programming*, where programs are written as a series of statements which modify the *state* of the computation environment.\n",
    "Typically, within functional programming, great focus is placed on *composition*, *immutability* and  *purity*.\n",
    "We are going to define these terms in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Functional Programming\n",
    "Why do we choose functional programming? There are a series of advantages to this approach, namely:\n",
    "- **Debugging** and **testing** are easy: there are no surprises because every function only does one thing and does not affect any other piece of the program.\n",
    "- **Parallelization** is trivial: functions are just small *boxes* that take one input and produce an output and do not depend on other parts of the code in an implicit manner through global variables or other shared pieces of state. Thus, it's easy to make several functions run in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basic principles of functional programming\n",
    "All modern programming languages have *functions* (or methods, procedures, subroutines, subprograms); these are groups of program statements that perform a certain computation. Functions are defined once for the whole program and can be reused at will throughout the program whenever we need to perform the specific computation they are defined for. Using functions, we can split our code in smaller units that are only responsible for a specific *functionality*; this helps us structuring our code in a clean and understandable form. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main principles we use in functional programming are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Purity*\n",
    "- *Functions as values* (*higher order functions*)\n",
    "- *Immutability of data*\n",
    "- *Composition*\n",
    "- *Referential transparency*\n",
    "- *Type systems*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few sections, we are going to briefly explore these concepts with some examples."
