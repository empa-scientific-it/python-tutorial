    "# Functional Programming in Python\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Functional programming is an approach to programming where programs are built by composing and running functions that perform a series of transformation on data. This is in contrast with the common approach of *imperative programming*, where programs are written as series of statements which modify the *state* of the computation environment. Normally within functional programming, great focus is placed on *composability*, *immutability* and  *purity*. We are going to define these terms in more detail later.\n",
    "## Why Functional Programming\n",
    "Why do we choose functional programming? There are a series of advantages to this approach, namely:\n",
    "- **Debugging** and **testing** are easy: there are no surprises because every function only does one thing and does not affect any other piece of the program.\n",
    "- **Parallelisation** is trivial: because functions are just small boxes that take one input and produce an output and do not depend implicitely on other parts of the code, it is easy to make several functions run in parallel.\n",
    "## The basic principles of functional programming\n",
    "All modern programming languages have *functions* (or methods, procedures, subroutines, subprograms); these are groups of program statements that perform a certain computation. Functions are defined once for the whole program and can be reused at will throughout the program whenever we need to perform the specific computation they are defined for. Using functions, we can split our code in smaller units that are only responsible for a specific *functionality*; this helps us structuring our code in a clean and understandable form. \n",
    "### Pure Functions\n",
    "In functional programming, we try to strive for *purity*, that is we want to define and use functions that only depend on their input, always return the same output for the same inputs and do not have any *side effects*, that is they do not indirectly affect any other part of our program. You can think of these functions as mathematical functions. \n",
    "Other examples of side effects are:\n",
    "- printing to the program output\n",
    "- reading or writing files\n",
    "- generating and using random numbers\n",
    "To besser understand this concept, let us look at the function `my_first_pure_function` we defined below:\n"
