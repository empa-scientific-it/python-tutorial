    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of OOP and is a concept that plays a crucial role in Python and other OOP languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also involves controlling the access to the data and methods, restricting direct access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of encapsulation is to hide the internal implementation details of a class and provide a simpler and cleaner way of interacting with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using encapsulation you can:\n",
    "- Protect the data by controlling how it is accessed and modified.\n",
    "- Enforce constraints and validation on data changes.\n",
    "- Make it easier to change the internal implementation of a class without affecting external code that uses the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is implemented using access modifiers and naming conventions.\n",
    "There are three commonly used access modifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public\n",
    "In Python, all attributes and methods are public by default, which means they can be accessed from anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private\n",
    "Attributes and methods with names starting with a double underscore (e.g., __variable, __method()) are considered private. \n",
    "They are not intended to be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python does not enforce strict access control, so you can still access them using name mangling (e.g., _classname__variable)."
