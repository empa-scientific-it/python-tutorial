    "This sentence may seem another trivial one: to execute a function, you must **call it**. In Python, it means using the `function_name()` with **parentheses**, enclosing any argument if need be.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a function in Python, three things happen: calling, executing, and returning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calling**: When you call a function, Python creates a new function call frame on the call stack. A function call frame contains information about the function call, such as the function name, arguments, local variables, and the return address (i.e., where to return control when the function returns). The function call frame is pushed onto the top of the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Executing**: After the function call frame is created, control is transferred to the function body. The function body is executed from top to bottom, line by line. The function can access its parameters, declare local variables, and perform any other operations specified in the body. The function can call other functions, which will create their own function call frames and push them onto the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Returning**: When the function reaches the end of the body or encounters a return statement, the function returns control to the calling code. The function call frame is popped from the call stack, and any local variables and parameters are discarded. The function returns a value if specified in the return statement, otherwise it returns `None` (remember: every function in Python returns **at least** `None`)\n",
    "\n",
