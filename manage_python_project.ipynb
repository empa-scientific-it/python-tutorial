    "## Code coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Test coverage is defined as the percentage of code that is being executed during the tests with respect to the total amount of loaded code.\n",
    "To make this clear, let's consider the following example.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def do_something(condition):\n",

    "def test_do_something():\n",
    "    assert do_something(True) == 1\n",
    "```\n",

    "    assert do_something(True) == 1\n",
    "    assert do_something(False) == 2\n",
    "```\n",

    "The code coverage is a good indicator of the quality of the tests, but can we feel safe if the test coverage is 100%?\n",
    "The answer is no.\n",
    "The test coverage only tells us that the code is executed during the tests.\n",
    "However, there might be external factors that are not taken into account by the tests.\n",
    "Consider a simple example of a function that returns the division of two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",

    "def test_divide():\n",
    "    assert divide(1, 2) == 0.5\n",

    "\n",
    "So far we talked about the documentation that is written in the code.\n",
    "However, most of the time the documentation is written in a separate file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the documentation is written in [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) or [Markdown](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html).\n",
    "We will focus on Markdown, as it is more popular and easier to use.\n",
    "For example, this tutorial is written in Markdown language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basic rules of Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Headers are created with `#` signs.\n",
    "More `#` signs mean smaller headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists are created with `-` or `*` signs.\n",
    "Indentation is used to create sub-lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Links are created with `[text](url)`.\n",
    "For example, [this link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) points to the Markdown guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images are created with `![alt text](url)`.\n",
    "For example, ![this](https://www.i2clipart.com/cliparts/4/d/e/5/1282254de556299e91214246aa0733b660a85d.png) is a cat image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code blocks are created with three backticks.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x**2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Math formulas are created with `$` signs.\n",
    "For example, the formula $x^2$ is created with `$x^2$`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the basics of Markdown, let's see where they can be used."

    "    'version = \"{pep440_version}\"',\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the setup above we have configured `bumpver` to update the version in the `__init__.py` file of the package and in the `pyproject.toml` file.\n",
    "The current version is `v0.2.3` and the version pattern is `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[PYTAGNUM]`, which corresponds to the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme.\n",
    "The commit message will be `Bump version {old_version} -> {new_version}.`.\n",
    "The git actions such as the commit, tag, and push will be performed automatically by `bumpver`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the version, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bumpver update --minor --dry\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since the `--dry` flag is used, the version will not be updated, but the proposed changes will be printed to the console.\n",
    "In the example above we expect only the `MINOR` part of the version to be updated, as we have used the `--minor` flag.\n",
