    "\n",
    "[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-commit hooks are small scripts that are executed before a commit is created.\n",
    "These scripts can be used to check the code for formatting errors, syntax errors, and other issues.\n",
    "If a pre-commit hook fails, the commit is aborted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install pre-commit, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pre-commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is common to install pre-commit as part of the development dependencies, see [above](#Optional-dependencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure pre-commit, we need to create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of the repository.\n",
    "This file contains the configuration of the pre-commit hooks.\n",
    "The following example shows how to configure pre-commit to \n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "repos:\n",
    "-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n",

    "    hooks:\n",
    "    -   id: black\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we provide a list of repositories and for each repository we specify the revision (version in other words) and the hooks that we want to use.\n",
    "This is by far not the complete configuration, but it is a good start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-commit supports a wide range of hooks.\n",
    "The full list can be found [here](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html).\n",
    "However, in this tutorial we will only discuss the commonly used ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auto-formatters\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-formatters are tools that automatically format the code.\n",
    "They take away from you the burden of ensuring the consistency of the code style.\n",
    "We recommend to use the following formatters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for sorting imports.\n",
    "- [autoflake](https://github.com/PyCQA/autoflake) for removing unused imports and variables.\n",
    "- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for an uncompromising code formatting (it really is!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the configuration of these formatters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort\n",

    "        hooks:\n",
    "          - id: flake8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that with the default configuration `flake8` conflicts with `black`.\n",
    "To avoid this conflict, we need to configure `flake8` to ignore the formatting issues.\n",
    "Here is the configuration of `flake8` to be put to `.flake8` file in the root of the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[flake8]\n",
    "extend-ignore =\n",
    "    E501\n",
    "    W503\n",
    "    E203\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The vanilla `flake8` provides only basic checks.\n",
    "However, its functionality can be extended with plugins.\n",
    "For example, we recommend to use the following plugins:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [flake8-bugbear](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear) for finding common bugs and design problems.\n",
    "- [flake8-builtins](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-builtins/) for verifying that builtins are not used as variable names.\n",
    "- [flake8-comprehensions](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-comprehensions/) for writing better and consistent comprehensions.\n",
    "- [flake8-debugger](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-debugger/) for checking that there are no forgotten [breakpoints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#breakpoint).\n",
    "- [flake8-eradicate](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-eradicate/) to avoid “dead” or commented code.\n",
    "- [flake8-logging-format](https://github.com/globality-corp/flake8-logging-format) for consistent logging.\n",
    "- [pep8-naming](https://pypi.org/project/pep8-naming/) for verifying that PEP8 naming conventions are followed.\n",
    "- [tryceratops](https://pypi.org/project/tryceratops/) to avoid exception anti-patterns.\n",

    "Here is the configuration of these plugins:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8\n",

    "The closest sub-category of system testing to our case is **smoke testing**.\n",

    "## Code coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Test coverage is defined as the percentage of code that is being executed during the tests with respect to the total amount of loaded code.\n",
    "To make this clear, let's consider the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def do_something(condition):\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the function `do_something` has two branches: one for `True` and one for `False`.\n",
    "If we only test the `True` branch, the test coverage won't be 100%, as the `False` branch is not tested.\n",
    "To achieve 100% test coverage, we need to test both branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code coverage is a good indicator of the quality of the tests, but can we feel safe if the test coverage is 100%?\n",
    "The answer is no.\n",
    "The test coverage only tells us that the code is executed during the tests.\n",
    "However, there might be external factors that are not taken into account by the tests.\n",
    "Consider a simple example of a function that returns the division of two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to write a test for this function, keeping the code coverage at 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_divide():\n",
    "    assert divide(1, 2) == 0.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this test does not take into account the case when the second argument is zero.\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Remember:</b> 100% code coverage does not mean that the code is bug-free, remember to test edge cases.\n",
    "</div>"
