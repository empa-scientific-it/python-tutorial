    "Image Classification is a foundational task in the field of computer vision and machine learning.\n",
    "This notebook aims to provide practical experience in image processing and in building and evaluating image classification models. \n",
    "\n",
    "It begins by demonstrating how to load and preprocess image data using Matplotlib and OpenCV-Python.\n",
    "Then, it shows how to build a basic image classification pipeline based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using PyTorch, Albumentations, and Scikit-learn.\n",
    "Next, it covers how to evaluate model performance using Scikit-learn and NumPy, and finally, it introduces model explainability using Grad-CAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is not to teach the underlying algorithms and procedures used in this field, but rather to give the user an idea of what can be done with these Python libraries."

    "`kernel_size = 3` means the scanning window is 3x3 pixels. The value is empirical.\n",

    "```\n",
    "This layer shrinks the size of the image while keeping the most important info (max values).\n",

    "Next, we define the layer that transforms the data from 2D images into an 1D vector (like stretching out a grid of pixels into a line):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.flatten = nn.Flatten(start_dim=1)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p = 0.3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This layer randomly turns off a pre-define percentage of neurons (`p = 0.3`) during training to prevent overfitting â€” so the model does not memorize the training data too closely.\n",
    "Finally, we define the classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.out_classes = out_classes\n",
    "self.fc = nn.Linear(1024, self.out_classes)\n",

    "Then, split the image into Hue, Saturation, and Value channels with [`cv2.split`](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/df/df2/group__core__hal__interface__split.html).\n",
    "Modify the Saturation channel as needed, merge the channels back together using [`cv2.merge`](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/df/d2e/group__core__hal__interface__merge.html), and finally convert the image back to the RGB color space."
