    "Image Classification is a foundational task in the field of computer vision and machine learning. This notebook aims to provide practical experience in image processing and in building and evaluating image classification models. \n",
    "\n",
    "It begins by demonstrating how to load and preprocess image data using Matplotlib and OpenCV-Python. Then, it shows how to build a basic image classification pipeline based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using PyTorch, Albumentations, and Scikit-learn. Next, it covers how to evaluate model performance using Scikit-learn and NumPy, and finally, it introduces model explainability using Grad-CAM.\n",

    "The goal of this notebook is not to teach the underlying algorithms and procedures used in this field, but rather to give the user an idea of what can be done with these Python libraries."

    "```\n",
    "This layer randomly turns off a pre-define percentage of neurons (`p = 0.3`) during training to prevent overfitting — so the model does not memorize the training data too closely.\n",

    "Finally, we define the classifier:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.out_classes = out_classes\n",
    "self.fc = nn.Linear(1024, self.out_classes)\n",
    "```\n",

It is typically treated as a hyperparameter, as its optimal value depends on hardware constraints (e.g., GPU memory) and its interaction with training dynamics. Notably, it is often linearly related with the learning rate. Larger batch sizes generally require proportionally larger learning rates to maintain stable and efficient convergence. ```shuffle``` controls whether the dataset is randomly permuted at the start of each epoch.

In this notebook we are going to define the number of epochs, which are the number of times the model is going to see the training set. Early stopping is a way of trying to avoid overfitting where the model evaluates the model every new epoch using a validation set. In case the loss obtained for the validation set does not decrease for a long period of time (pre-defined epochs), the model optimisation stops and retrieves the checkpoint where the validation loss got the last decrease (see [Early Stopping](https://paperswithcode.com/method/early-stopping)). Learning rate defined how quick the models weights should change during training. If it is too high the weights are going to change really quick and might miss minima because they are always jumping from one side to another side. If it is too small the model weights might get stuck a local minimum.

    "### Model Training Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Model training involves a sequence of key steps. The first step is to check which computational devices are available. If a GPU with CUDA cores is accessible, it should be used, as it significantly accelerates training (```DEVICE = torch.device(\"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")```). Otherwise, the model will be trained on the CPU. Next, we define the model and training hyperparameters. These typically include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of output classes  (```NUMBER_CLASSES = len(CIFAR_10_CLASSES)```);\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of training epochs (i.e., how many times the model sees the full training set)  (```EPOCHS = 500```);\n",
    "\n",
    "- The patience for early stopping (i.e., how many consecutive epochs without improvement are allowed before stopping training)  (```EARLY_STOPPING_LIMIT = EPOCHS // 10```);\n",
    "\n",
    "- The learning rate (```LR = 0.001```).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional hyperparameters may also be configured depending on the training strategy or specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on setting the number of training epochs. We also discuss **early stopping**, a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. During training, the model's performance is evaluated on a validation set at the end of each epoch. If the validation loss does not improve after a predefined number of epochs, training is stopped, and the model reverts to the best-performing checkpoint (see [Early Stopping](https://paperswithcode.com/method/early-stopping)). The **learning rate** controls how quickly the model updates its weights during training. If it's too high, the model may overshoot optimal loss values, leading to instability. If it's too low, the model may converge very slowly or get stuck in a local minimum. Although learning rate tuning is not performed in this notebook, it is an essential hyperparameter that should be carefully selected (see [What is learning rate in machine learning?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/learning-rate)).\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting the hyperparameters, we define the **loss function** used to evaluate model performance (```criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()```). Both the model and loss function should be moved to the selected training device (```criterion = criterion.to(DEVICE)```). The model is then instantiated using the `ImageClassifier` class (```model = ImageClassifier(in_channels = 3, out_classes = NUMBER_CLASSES)```) and transferred to the training device (```model = model.to(DEVICE)```). The **optimizer** is also defined and configured on the same device (```optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr = LR)```).\n",
    "\n",

    "Deep neural networks are often described as \"black boxes\" because their decision-making processes are difficult to understand and interpret. To address this, researchers have developed various methods to make these models more explainable. One such method is Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping). Grad-CAM computes the gradients of a target class with respect to the final convolutional layers and generates a heatmap that highlights the regions of the input image most influential in the model’s prediction for that class."
