    "There are many cases where we could execute multiple tasks in parallel or switch between tasks while we wait for some time-consuming task to be completed.\n",

    "\n",
    "- While your soup cooks on the stove, you start washing your dishes\n",
    "- You check the news while drinking your morning coffee\n",
    "- You work on your python course exercises while attending a video call\n",

    "Indeed, the language of computing is so engrained in many of us that today we refer to these sort of behaviors as *multitasking*, an expression borrowed from computer science.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Parallelism\n",
    "When we have two or more tasks *running and progressing simultaneously*, we can talk about **parallelism**. \n",
    "Think for example of the situation of paying at the supermarket where there are multiple lines: more than one customer can pay their purchases at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concurrency\n",
    "When two or more tasks run in overlapping time periods (but **not necessarily simultaneously**) instead of sequentially, we say that their execution is **concurrent**.\n",
    "This is the typical human multitasking, where we work on multiple tasks in a time period, but we must switch between them to be able to perform them correctly.\n",
    "For example, we sit in a meeting, listen passively while working on our python program and stop working on our code to answer a question directed to us.\n",

    "Let's now understand how this code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we define two different `dataclasses` to represent the objects we will put in the queue. \n",
    "The class `QueueItem` will represent a number produced by one producer, while `Stop` represents the case where a producer is finished with its work.\n",
    "The function `producer` takes the initial number of the sequence and the maximum, as well as `Queue` where its data should be put in.\n",
    "The function iterates over the `generate_items` generator, for each number it produces, it puts it on the queue.\n",
    "When no items are available anymore, it puts a `Stop` signal instead.\n",
    "The message send with `Stop` also contains the name of who puts the message; this is used later to know when to stop.\n",
    "Now we can analyze `consumer`; this function takes a queue as well as the names of the producers. \n",
    "The function runs an infinite loop and keeps receiving messages from the queue; when the message matches with a `QueueItem`, it extracts the number, prints a message and increments the sum.\n",
    "When the function receives  a `Stop`, it extracts the name of the sender of the stop message and adds it to the set of senders. \n",
    "When it receives the stop signal from all the senders, it exits the loop and prints the final sum to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now look at the function `producer_consumer`, we see that we initialize a queue as well as two `Process` for the producers, to which we pass the initial value of the sequence and the queue we just created.\n",
    "We also create a new `consumer` and we pass the same queue to it, for it to be able to communicate with the producers.\n",
    "Finally, we start all the processes and call their `join` method in order to wait for them to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the producers alternate in sending messages; this is thank to the line `queue = Queue(maxsize=1)`. \n",
    "This forces the queue to have a maximum size of one element; that means that we have the following sequence:\n",
    "1. `Producer1` puts an element on the queue\n",
    "2. `Producer1` moves to the next iteration \n",
    "3. Because the queue is already filled, `put` blocks\n",
    "4. `consumer` gets the first element from `Producer1` from the queue\n",
    "5. Now one of the two producers can again put an element on the queue. We can't guarantee which producer, but there's a good chance any of them at random gets to put an element.\n",
    "6. The cycle repeats.\n",

    "### Threads, GIL and the illusion of concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we only discussed one approach to concurrency (and parallelism) in python:  the use of operating system **processes** leveraging the ability of the OS to schedule and coordinate multiple processes across multiple CPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Threads vs processes\n",
    "Other than multiprocessing, there's a second, very similar approach  called **threading**. \n",
    "Like a **process**, a **thread** is a representation of a task including all needed resources. \n",
    "In fact, a process usually consists of multiple threads all sharing a common block of memory. \n",
    "Because of shared memory, a thread is usually lighter in its resource usage than a process, meaning that we can start more threads.\n",
    "Moreover the shared memory means that multiple threads can communicate using shared variables. \n",
    "Even if this is possible, this style of concurrency comes with severe performance and safety pitfalls and it is discouraged in most cases. \n",
    "Considering all this, in most programming languages we try to achieve concurrency by starting multiple threads in a process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the way the python interpreter is written (the infamous [global interpreter lock](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock)), we cannot get any performance benefits from running python code across multiple threads: only one thread can perform CPU operations at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to use threads\n",
    "However, there are some cases where we could benefit from this style: when we have multiple threads sitting and waiting for input from the network or another process, but that don't perform any heavy computation.\n",
    "This is a case commonly encountered in user interface programming, where we don't want the main user interface to block waiting for the program to fetch data from the network.\n",
    "In that situation, we can run the GUI in a main thread and have a second thread being responsible for network interaction. \n",
    "Here we won't have any speedup but we will give the user the **illusion** of concurrency because the GUI won't freeze while the network thread fetches the data.\n",

    "1. every time we **await** the `get_value` coroutine method,  it returns a a character. If you run:\n",

    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "1. If we can get all the characters from the server, they form a sequence that is the secret password to our server:\n",
    "   1. The beginning and end of the sequence are separated by the character `/`.\n",
    "2. **But be careful!**: the server has a special security mechanism: \n",
    "   1. after the first time you call it, you only have a limited number of times to try and call `get_value`. \n",
    "   2. If you wait too long to get the next character, the sequence will reset. \n",
    "   3. In this case too the server will return `/` and then restart.\n",

    "Your task is to write a **coroutine** that gathers all characters from the server that form a sentence delimited by `/` and use them as a password to get the secret message.\n",
