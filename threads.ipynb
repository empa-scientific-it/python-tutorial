    "# Parallelism and concurrency in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "There are many cases where we could execute multiple tasks in parallel or switch between tasks while we wait for some time consuming task to be completed.\n",
    "You can just think of examples from daily life to see why: \n",
    "\n",
    "- While your soup cooks on the stove, you start washing your dishes\n",
    "- You check the news while drinking your morning coffee\n",
    "- You work on your python course exercises while attending a video call\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the language of computing is so engrained in many of us that today we refer to these sort of behaviors as *multitasking*, an expression borrowed from computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because in computer science we like to be precise, let us define these terms better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parallelism Vs. concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallelism\n",
    "When we have two or more tasks *running and progressing simultaneously*, we can talk about **parallelism**. \n",
    "Think for example of the situation of paying at the supermarket where there are multiple lines: more than one customer can pay their purchases at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concurrency\n",
    "When two or more tasks run in overlapping time periods (but **not necessarily simultaneously**) instead of sequentially, we say that their execution is **concurrent**.\n",
    "This is the typical human multitasking, where we work on multiple tasks in a time period, but we must switch between them to be able to perform them correctly.\n",
    "For example, we sit in a meeting, listen passively while working on our python program and stop working on our code to answer a question directed to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Threads, GIL and the illusion of concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we only discussed one approach to concurrency (and parallelism) in python:  the use of operating system **processes** leveraging the ability of the OS to schedule and coordinate multiple processes across multiple CPUs. \n",
    "In reality, there's a second, very similar approach commonly called **threading**. \n",
    "Like a **process**, a **thread** is a representation of a task including all needed resources. \n",
    "In fact, a process usually consist of multiple threads all sharing a common memory. \n",
    "Because of shared memory, a thread is usually lighter in its resource usage than a process, moreover the shared memory means that multiple threads can communicate using shared variables, although this style of concurrency comes with severe performance and safety pitfalls and it is being increasingly discouraged. \n",
    "Therefore, in most programming languages we try to achieve concurrency by starting multiple threads in a process.  \n",
    "However, due to the way the python interpreter is written (the infamous [global interpreter lock](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock)), we cannot get any performance benefits from running python code across multiple threads: only one thread can perform CPU operations at a time. \n",
    "There are however some cases where we could benefit from this style: when we have multiple threads sitting and waiting from input from the network or from some other process. \n",
    "This is a case commonly encountered in user interface programming, where we don't want the main user interface to block waiting for the program to fetch data from the network.\n",
    "In that situation, we can run the GUI in a main thread and have a second thread being responsible for network interaction. \n",
    "Here we won't have any speedup but we will give the user the **illusion** of concurrency because the GUI won't freeze while the network threads goes and gets the data.\n",
